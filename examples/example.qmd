[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) allows us to add computations from a variety of languages to our markdown-like documents.

Below is an R code block followed by its output:
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

mtcars |>
    ggplot(aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
    geom_point() +
    labs(title = "Miles per Gallon vs Weight")
```


Below is a Python code block followed by its output:
```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

mtcars = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/mtcars.csv")

plt.scatter(x=mtcars.wt, y=mtcars.mpg)
plt.title("Miles per Gallon vs Weight")
plt.show()
```
