Assume the popular “mtcars” dataset was shared for the Master Quest topic. Below are some ways you could visualize and share your work so others can see how you did it.

## Jupyter Notebooks
Simply [link to it on GitHub](https://github.com/flatiron-labs/ds-mastery-quests/blob/main/examples/jupyter-in-quarto.ipynb){target="_blank"}

## Quarto
Use [Quarto](https://quarto.org){target="_blank"} and GitHub pages to render your work as a static site (like this one!)

See [documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/){target="_blank"} for other ways to publish

## Observable
If JavaScript is your thing, try [Observable notebooks](https://observablehq.com/@bletchleyinstitute-ws/observablejs-example){target="_blank"} or use [`ojs` computations in Quarto](quarto-doc.html#observable-js)
