# Data Science Weekly Drills
## Who, What, When, Where, Why
Data newcomers, hobbyists, and professionals are encouraged to create and share a data visualization, model, app, or other data-related output based on a weekly topic or shared dataset posted in [Discord channel], on [bletchley.org], and [social media]. Our goal is to foster our community to share tips, tricks, assistance, and inspiration for creating data output.

## How
1. Each week a topic or dataset will be shared [Discord channel], on [bletchley.org], and [social media]
    - Find a dataset related to the topic of the week
    - If a dataset is provided, download it
2. Explore the data and create a visualization, model, app, or other data-related output, using the tool of your choice
3. Share your creation
    - The goal is to practice and improve, so even a simple graph that shows something interesting or leverages a new package is worth sharing!
    - Paste a screenshot of your creation to [Discord channel] using the hashtags [insert hashtags]
    - We also encourage you to share how you created it and link to any related code, notebook, or live output so others can learn and find inspiration from you. See below for a few examples.
4. <TBD>Prizes, badges, social media shoutouts for:
    - Best data visualization
    - Most interesting insight
    - Most innovative creation

## Examples
Assume the popular “mtcars” dataset was shared for the weekly data science drill. Below are some ways you could visualize and share your work so others can see how you did it.
