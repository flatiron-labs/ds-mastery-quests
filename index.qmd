## Data Science Mastery Quests
Data newcomers, hobbyists, and professionals are encouraged to create and share a data visualization, model, app, or other data-related output based on the topic or shared dataset posted in the Bletchley Discord [#contests](https://discord.gg/SjGxcVTp) channel. Our goal is to foster our community to share tips, tricks, assistance, and inspiration for creating data output.

## Participating
1. Every other week a topic or dataset will be shared in [#contests](https://discord.gg/SjGxcVTp)
    - Find a dataset related to the topic of the week
    - If a dataset is provided, download it
2. Explore the data and create a visualization, model, app, or other data-related output, using the tool of your choice
3. Share your creation
    - The goal is to practice and improve, so even a simple graph that shows something interesting or leverages a new-to-you technology is worth sharing!
    - Paste a screenshot of your creation to [#contests](https://discord.gg/SjGxcVTp)
    - We also encourage you to share how you created it and link to any related code, notebook, or live output so others can learn and find inspiration from you. See [here](/examples/) for a few examples.
4. Prizes, badges, and social media shoutouts will be awarded based on the following criteria:
    - **Relevance:** How well does the project align with the theme?
    - **Creativity:** How original and innovative is the concept?
    - **Functionality:** Does the visualization convey the data effectively? Is it user-friendly?
    - **Presentation:** How visually appealing is the design? Is the visualization clear and informative?
