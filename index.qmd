## Who, What, When, Where, Why
Data newcomers, hobbyists, and professionals are encouraged to create and share a data visualization, model, app, or other data-related output based on a weekly topic or shared dataset posted in [Discord channel], on [bletchley.org], and [social media]. Our goal is to foster our community to share tips, tricks, assistance, and inspiration for creating data output.

## How

2. Explore the data and create a visualization, model, app, or other data-related output, using the tool of your choice
3. Share your creation
    - The goal is to practice and improve, so even a simple graph that shows something interesting or leverages a new package is worth sharing!
    - Paste a screenshot of your creation to [Discord channel] using the hashtags [insert hashtags]
